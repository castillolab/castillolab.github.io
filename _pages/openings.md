# Open positions

We are always looking to recruit talented students and researchers.

To help solve Darwin's "mystery of mysteries", the process by which new species are formed, lab members receive training in a variety of tools/techniques including: the use cutting edge genetic techniques, genomics, behavioral observations, reproductive biology and gas-chromatography.


### Current open positions

### Lab Technician
We are recruiting a lab manager to assist with projects centered on the evolutionary genetics of animal mating behaviors and interactions, interspecies interactions, and speciation. This would be an ideal opportunity for a post-baccalaureate individual to gain individual research experience for 1-2 years before applying to grad schools. Previous laboratory experience in genetics is desirable. The ideal candidate will have demonstrated initiative, curiosity and dedication to scientific research, as well as the ability to work independently and in a team environment.

A list of some responsibilities includes 1) Maintaining Drosophila and nematode laboratory cultures and processing field samples, 2) Ordering supplies and managing the lab and maintaining equipment, 3) Training and managing undergraduate researchers 4) Collecting, managing, and analyzing behavioral, genetic, and chemical data and providing written summaries, 5) Using molecular biology to generate mutant strains necessary for behavioral experiments.

Interested individuals should email [Dean](mailto:dmc79@cornell.edu) with a brief statement of your research interests and experiences, CV and references, and summary of goals/plans for future graduate study.

### Applications for Postdoc positions
We are recruiting a postdoc with a strong background and/or interest in evolutionary genetics, transcriptomics or proteomics and molecular genetics. The applicant will help develop tools to link genotypic and phenotypic evolution, to understand broadly how behavior and mating traits contribute to speciation and biodiversity. This position is flexible, and the postdoc will be encouraged to contribute to collaborate projects as well as continuing to develop their own research program using these techniques. 

The ideal candidate will have demonstrable experience with the generation or analysis of genomic datasets and/or molecular genetics. Data management skills are essential. Applicants should also have evidence of their creativity and potential, including publications that demonstrate their skills in evolutionary genetics research.
 
The start date for this position is flexible and interested individuals should send their CV and references, dissertation summary, and summary statement of career plan andgoals to [Dean](mailto: dmc79@cornell.edu). While this position is funded for 2-3 years I will encourage successful applicants to work with me to submit [NIH NRSA](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/contacts/parent_F32.html) and [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/education.jsp?fund_type=3) postdoctoral fellowships and will help you identify other fellowship opportunities.


### Applications for PhD positions
Graduate students can apply through two different programs within the [School of Biological Sciences Graduate Program](https://www.biology.utah.edu/graduate/index.php). The application deadline is January 3, 2019 and there is no application fee. 

The School of Biological Sciences has strong and growing community of [evolutionary geneticists](https://www.biology.utah.edu/research/interest.php?int=9) making it a great place for collaborative science.

Before applying, interested students should email [Dean](mailto:dmc79@cornell.edu) with a brief statement of your research interests and experiences, CV, and three references.
Informal questions about my lab and the graduate program at Utah are also welcome.


<!--### Undergraduate Researchers
If you are interested in pursuing a Master degree at Leiden University, see [mastersinleiden.nl](http://www.mastersinleiden.nl/programmes/physics/en/introduction). Sometimes, we take master students or summer interns if we get exceptional applicants (this usually means very good grades and a personal recommendation).-->
